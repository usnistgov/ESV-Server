[1.3] - Release date TBD

ADDED

   * HOut is now required to be collected for Conditioning Components, so "hOut" will need to be added for each "conditioningComponent" in entropy-source-metadata.json
   * "AlphabetSize" is no longer used so can be safely removed from entropy-source-metadata.json
   * Better error reporting when parsing "bad" configuration files
   * Now allows for multiple sets of DataFiles for multiple Operating Environments
      * This changes the structure of the run.json file.
         * Datafiles is now an array of sets of DataFile locations and OE IDs instead of just an individual collection of DataFile locations.
         * The array oeID is no longer located under "Assessments", now each oeID is associated with a set of DataFile locations.
         * Example:
 
        "DataFiles": [
            {
                "oeID": 1,
                "rawNoisePath": "/path/to/truerand_4bit.bin",
                "restartTestPath": "/path/to/truerand_4bit.bin",
                "unvettedConditionedPaths": [
                    "/path/to/truerand_4bit.bin",
                    "/path/to/truerand_4bit.bin"
                ]
            }
        ]
